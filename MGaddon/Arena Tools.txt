#Arena Subroutines. Requires Sk+. First Release, Untested since i am lazy but it should work//Mirreducki.
#If you see anything wrong you can change it. Like at my Example..

#Need to add the mg. before the variable's name

#Simple Arena Randomizer. 
#{Chosen.Arena} holds the highest voted arena.
#Usage: invoke "Random Arena"				
sub "Random Arena":
	loop {mg.arena.name::*}:
		if {mg.arena.flag.%loop-value%::enabled} is "TRUE": #Checks if the arena is enabled. Other checks can be added here.
			add loop-value to {_random::*}
	set {_random} to random element out of {_random::*}
	set {Chosen.Arena} to {_random}
	

	
	
	
#Votes Arena Calculator. Thanks to cam13619 for the original. Edited by Mirreducki.
#Gets the Highest voted Arena.
#{Votes::*} should hold the votes of every arena like this:
#{Votes::ExampleArena} = Number of Votes.
#{Chosen.Arena} holds the highest voted arena.

#Usage: invoke "Vote Calc"
sub "Vote Calc":
	if {Votes::*} is not set:										
		stop
	loop {Votes::*}:
		set {_topvote} to loop-value
		set {_vote.topmaps::%loop-index%} to loop-index
		exit loop
	loop {Votes::*}:
		{_vote.topmaps::%loop-index%} is not set 
		if {_topvote} is equal to loop-value:
			set {_vote.topmaps::%loop-index%} to loop-index
		if {_topvote} is less than loop-value:
			clear {_vote.topmaps::*}
			set {_topvote} to loop-value
			set {_vote.topmaps::%loop-index%} to loop-index
	loop {_vote.topmaps::*}:
		set {_topmapcount} to {_topmapcount}+1
	set {_selectedmap} to random integer between 1 and {_topmapcount}
	loop {_vote.topmaps::*}:
		set {_viewed map} to {_viewed map}+1
		{_viewed map} is equal to {_selectedmap}
		set {_selectedmap} to loop-index
		exit loop
	set {Chosen.Arena} to {_selectedmap}
	
	
#Example Use:
#Command /start game:
#	trigger:
#		invoke "Random Arena" #Now the variable {Chosen.Arena} holds the random arena.
#		teleport all players to {mg.arena.flag.%{Chosen.Arena}%::spawn} #Teleports all players to the chosen arenas spawn.
#Notes: I am not sure if the flag "spawn" holds the location of the arena spawn or not.
#Notes: You can replace the Invoke "Random Arena" with the Invoke "Vote Calc".
