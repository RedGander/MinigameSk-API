#Main Idea
mga = minigame arena
mgu = minigame user
mgo = minigame options


#Main Vars
mga.%arenaName%::vars
mgu.%player%::vars
mgo.%arenaName%::vars


I know, 2 vars array for the same arena… I think is will be more easy to manage and read, plus the options are all apart from the main arena default settings like the arena name and other non-options vars.


#Arena Vars

mga.%arenaName%::

name


#User Vars

mgu.%player%::

points
arena
spectator (true or false, need to think about spectator mode)

It should be cool to have an option to activate some "points" vars for dedicated mg's server


#Options Vars (a lot and need to think of what we really need)

mgo.%arenaName%::

minPlayers
maxPlayers
maxScore
spawn
team (true or false)
t1spawn (team 1 spawn)
t2spawn (team 2 spawn)
t3spawn (team 3 spawn)
t4spawn (team 4 spawn)
quit (quit position)
lobby (lobby position)
scoreType (this one should not be necessary because every external game type has his own score type method like tdm has kills, ctf has the captured flags…)


need to think about this possibility:
blockPlace
blockBrake
gamemode
checkpoint
reset
startTime
reward

and this one are far from now but should be considerate:
defaultWinner
blockDrop
itemPickup
itemDrop
restoreBlocks
unlimitedAmmo
