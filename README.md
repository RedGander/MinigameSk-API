Minigames Core API

We Need YOU and your experience here!
Help us adding your own code to make this project the MUST of minigames plugin!

How to do it
==========
Click on the minigamesk.sk file, then click on EDIT at the top right and write/add your own code!

What to do
=========
* Login/Logout system to an active minigame
* Minigames list
* List of players for that particular minigame (mayber this could be the scoreboard panel on the right)
* General Scoreboard command for creating a game
* Adding/Removing player to a game (to variables and scoreboard)
* Adding/Removing points to a player in a game (scoreboard)
* Reset the game (variables and scoreboard)
* Tell me what to add to this list...

Additional Possible Features:
* Minecraft Achievement
* "minigame points" as reward


I think that we can make a full scoreboard command set that make everything, so it's simpler to edit in the future and more compact!
